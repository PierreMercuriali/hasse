Boolean lattice and Hasse diagrams drawing script(s)

## Explanation
Draws a Boolean lattice of size 2^N, given input N. 
I needed a simple script to quickly visualize some big Boolean functions and their properties such as monotonicity and how their True and False points are localized.

## Examples
N = 3: 
![N=3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9059851c-cdd9-41dc-9ee8-7f8fa5fccbf3)

N = 6 : 
![N=6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7152145e-e7ff-4dd6-94c0-3e9913e948f8)
